# IROS2020-paper-list

The 2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2020) has been held on Oct 25 – Nov 25, not been held in-person. With the continued resurgence of COVID-19 within the State of Nevada, in particular Las Vegas, along with the city’s prohibiting large or even moderately-sized public gatherings, it makes it an impossibility to hold the in-person event as originally planned.

IROS is one of the largest and most impacting robotics research conferences worldwide. It brings an international community of researchers, educators and practitioners to explore the frontier of science and technology in intelligent robots and systems, and discuss the latest advancements in this fast growing and exciting field.

IROS 2020 is **free** with access to every Technical Talk, Plenary and Keynote, over 60 Workshops and Tutorials, the Competitions, and includes publishing of accepted papers in the IROS Proceedings and IEEE XPlore.
